The match and patch parts are removed, as well as all the extra diff options. What is incredibly fast diffing between two strings.\n\n The diff function is an implementation of [\"An O(ND) Difference Algorithm and its Variations\" (Myers, 1986)](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.4.6927&rep=rep1&type=pdf) with the suggested divide and conquer strategy along with several [optimizations](http://neil.fraser.name/news/2007/10/09/) Neil added.\n\n```js\nvar diff = require('fast-diff');\n\nvar good = 'Good dog';\nvar bad = 'Bad dog';\n\nvar result = diff(good, bad);\n// [[-1, \"Goo\"], [1, \"Ba\"], [0, \"d dog\"]]\n\n// For convenience\ndiff.INSERT === 1;\ndiff.EQUAL === 0;\ndiff.DELETE === -1;\n```\n",
